## About the project
The web app is a market place for selling used items that someone else might be interested in, the seller uploads certain information such as the photos of it,
description and price and the buyer can either comment on the post or send private message.
**Disclaimer:**
1. Every user's security is in his hands. All users are to deal with people within their locality or close range and meet in public places before paying for
the goods.
3. The risk of purchasing spoilt or bad items is entirely the users. He/she must test the item very well (if possible) before paying for it.
4. It is safer to buy from store owners but any user can sell or buy on the app, so everyone has got to be very careful while dealing with anyone, as we are
not responsible for the outcome of the deal.
