# Contibuting to the Project (tradeQuick)

This project is open sourced, and as a result, we appreciate every contribution that we can get from developers who are proficient or
just confident enough to add to the codebase, for any relevant addition or necessary improvement of any kind.
Hence, the following standard or rules are for the purpose of avoiding bugs, unecessary conflicts and crashing the application.

## Steps to Follow

### Fork the Repository

To contribute to [tradeQuick](https://github.com/tpauldike/tradeQuick), the first thing you should do (after identifying the problem
you want to solve and knowing what the application is about) is to fork [the repository](https://github.com/tpauldike/tradeQuick) and clone
it on your local machine.

### Create a New Branch

Once you have cloned the repository, create a new branch. This will ensure that your contributions remain separate
from the main codebase.

#### Branch Naming and Commit Messages

You are to adhere to the following naming conventions while creating your branch.
Begin the branch name with the `<prefix>` followed by a forward slash (`/`) and `<a_very_short_description>`; you may use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`)
to separate words. For example; `docs/correct-typo`. You may include issue or task number but that's optional.

The commit messages (when you push to git) should as well take the format `<prefix>(<short_subject>): <a_brief_and_precise_description>`. For example `docs(README): updated the instruction for usage`

Below are the prefixes that you might want to use, based on the kind of contribution you want to make to the project, and the brief descriptions,
so that you'll choose the right one for naming your branch and writing your commit messages.

| Prefix | Description |
| ----- | ------ |
| feature | Represents a new functionality or feature added to the software, typically user-facing and contribute to the overall enhancement of the application |
| chore | Refers to tasks that are necessary for the project but don't add new features or fix bugs directly. Examples include `maintenance` tasks, `refactoring`, or other non-functional improvements |
| hot-fix | A quick, unplanned patch or solution to address a critical bug or issue in the production environment. Hot-fixes are often created and deployed urgently to resolve immediate problems |
| config | Short for configuration. This category may include changes related to configuration files, settings, or environment-specific adjustments, ensuring the software adapts to different environments |
| docs | Involves documentation-related changes. This can include updating or adding documentation for code, processes, or other aspects of the project |
| style | Refers to changes made to improve the code style or formatting without affecting the actual functionality. This might include indentation, whitespace, or naming conventions |
| performance | Involves optimizations aimed at improving the performance of the software. This could include changes to algorithms, data structures, or resource utilization to make the system more efficient |

### Make Contributions

Now you can make your desired modifications or contributions to the codebase. Remember to always keep in mind the
project goals and adhere to the project coding conventions.

### Create a Pull Request

When your modifications and contributions are ready, create a pull request to the `development` branch. 
> *Note that there is a branch named `development`*, you're not allowed to push to the `production` branch

When creating a pull request, be sure to include (where necessary)
a detailed description and the necessary information such as screenshots, videos, or GIFs.

Before submitting the pull request, review all
changes thoroughly to make sure they meet the project goals and coding conventions. Your contribution may have to pass certain requirements
and tests for the pull request to be accepted

Please, do read through the Usage/Installation instructions and about tradeQuick to know the conception and goals before contributing.
